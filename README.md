# LZ77 Optimization Final Project
### Lycia Tran and Pranavi Boyalakuntla
### EE 274 Data Compression | Fall 2023 
### Stanford University

Final Project for EE274: Data Compression by Lycia Tran and Pranavi Boyalakuntla. The project was on the optimization of the LZ77 Algorithm currently implemented in the Stanford Compression Library. The optimizations we implemented were the addition of repcodes and changing the Entropy Coder to be rANS, tANS, and Arithmetic Coding.
