# LZ77 Optimization Final Project
### Lycia Tran and Pranavi Boyalakuntla
### EE 274 Data Compression | Fall 2023 
### Stanford University

Final Project for EE274: Data Compression by Lycia Tran and Pranavi Boyalakuntla. The project was on the optimization of the LZ77 Sliding Window Algorithm currently implemented in the Stanford Compression Library. The optimizations we implemented were the addition of repcodes and changing the Entropy Coder to be rANS, tANS, and Arithmetic Coding. 

To run the code:
1. Start by cloning the Stanford Compression Library repo (instructions linked below)
   https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library/blob/main/README.md

2. Download the files in the src folder in this repo. These files are the ones that were specifically modified to optimize the LZ77 Sliding Window Algorithm. The changes are marked by the keyword "TODO" to make it easy to find.

3. Files used for compression tests used in our Final Report are in the src folder as well
